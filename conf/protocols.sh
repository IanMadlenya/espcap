# Use this script to generate a new set of tshark protocols. After 
# running, it remove the protocols from protocols.txt by either 
# commenting them out (with # character like a bash script) that 
# you aren't interested then save the new list as the file as 
# protocols.list. Note you should always exclude the protocols in 
# the current protocols.ini, should check which ones those are 
# before running this script.
